# 🛡️ Incident Handling Lab – Nexus Data Breach Simulation

Recently completed an **Incident Handling Lab** focused on a simulated **Nexus data breach**, applying industry-standard cybersecurity methodologies to **analyze, contain, and respond** to an active threat within a SOC environment.  
This lab followed the **Incident Response Lifecycle**, leveraging frameworks aligned with **NIST SP 800-61** and the **MITRE ATT&CK** matrix.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This hands-on simulation emphasized real-world **incident response** operations—covering detection, triage, containment, eradication, and recovery.  
The exercise replicated a **credential compromise** and **web application exploit**, testing analytical and procedural response capabilities within an enterprise SOC workflow.

## 🧰 Tools & Frameworks Used

- **Wazuh SIEM** – Log correlation, alert analysis, and threat detection  
- **Sysmon** – Process monitoring and event tracking  
- **TheHive** – Case management and incident workflow automation  
- **CyberChef** – Data decoding, MD5 hash analysis, and artifact extraction  
- **VirusTotal** – Threat verification and IP reputation checks  
- **MITRE ATT&CK** – Tactics and techniques mapping  
- **NIST 800-61** – Structured incident response lifecycle

## ⚙️ Key Skills Demonstrated

- 🕵️ **Threat Hunting & Triage:** Verified Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as suspicious IPs, file hashes, and network anomalies.  
- 🔐 **Exploit Investigation:** Identified a **ManageEngine credential compromise** and **PHP portal vulnerabilities** used for lateral movement and privilege escalation.  
- 📊 **Forensic Analysis:** Conducted memory dump and disk image investigations; correlated logs to pinpoint malicious activity.  
- 🧩 **Threat Intelligence:** Extracted and decoded threat actor IPs with CyberChef; validated sources with VirusTotal.  
- 🧹 **Remediation & Recovery:** Removed malicious artifacts, restored clean configurations, and validated system integrity.  

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Applied **end-to-end incident response** aligned with **NIST SP 800-61**.  
- Enhanced understanding of **SIEM-based detection**, **forensic workflows**, and **post-incident recovery**.  
- Strengthened analytical mindset for **SOC and Blue Team** operations.
